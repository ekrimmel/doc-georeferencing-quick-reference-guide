== Introduction

This is a practical guide for **<<georeference,georeferencing>>**. It describes the protocols to determine the shapes of **<<feature,features>>** and how to use them as the basis for georeferencing with the **<<point-radius>>** **<<georeferencing-method>>** (Wieczorek 2001, Wieczorek _et al._ 2004, Chapman & Wieczorek 2020) using the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[*_Georeferencing Calculator_*] (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2019), and its associated {gcm}[*_Georeferencing Calculator Manual_*] (Bloom _et al._ 2020), maps, **<<gazetteer,gazetteer>>**, and other resources from which **<<coordinates>>** and spatial **<<boundary,boundaries>>** for places can be found. This document is a citable **<<georeferencing-protocol>>**. If a derived protocol is used, a new document should be made publicly available and cited with attribution to this document.

The *_Guide_*, in its first version (Wieczorek _et al._ 2012), was an adaptation of *_Georeferencing for Dummies_* (Spencer _et al. n.dat._). It explains the recommended **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** procedures for the most commonly encountered type of **<<locality,localities>>**. This *_Guide_* should be used in parallel with {gbp}[*_Georeferencing Best Practices_*] (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020), which contains the theoretical background and more detailed information about concepts used here.

Throughout this document there are terms with a very specific meaning as it is being used here. Those that are presented <<accuracy,like this>> and have a link to the *_<<Glossary>>_* where they are defined in detail. Terms in italics and not bold (_e.g._, _Input Latitude_) are references to fields or labels in the *_Calculator_*. Terms in fixed-width font (_e.g._, term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks]) are names of terms in the *<<Darwin-Core>>.*

At the end of this document is a **<<key-to-locality-types,Georeference Quick Reference Guide Key to Locality Types>>**, which contains a quick summary of the **<<georeferencing-protocol,protocols>>** for the most common **<<locality-type,locality types>>**, described in detail in the sections of this guide.

=== Objectives

This document provides guidance on how to **<<georeference>>** using the **<<point-radius>>** **<<georeferencing-method,method>>**. This *_Guide_* also provides the methods for determining the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of **<<feature,features>>**, which form the basis of the **<<shape>>** **<<georeferencing-method,method>>**.

=== Target Audience

This document is a practical guide for anyone who needs to **<<georeference>>** textual **<<locality>>** descriptions so that they can be used in spatial filtering or analysis in research, education, or the maintenance of biological collections data.

=== Scope

This document is one of three that cover recommended requirements and methods to **<<georeference>>** **<<location,locations>>**. It provides a practical how-to guide for putting the theory of the **<<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method>>** into practice.

The *_Guide_* relies on the {gbp}[*_Georeferencing Best Practices_*] for background, definitions, and more detailed explanations of the theory behind the methods and calculations found here and in the *_Calculator_*.

The *_Georeferencing Calculator_* is a browser-based JavaScript application that aids in **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** descriptive **<<locality,localities>>**, making the calculations necessary to obtain **<<geographic-coordinates>>** and **<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>** for **<<location,locations>>** using the **<<point-radius>>** **<<georeferencing-method,method>>**.

These documents DO NOT provide guidance on georectifying images or **<<geocode,geocoding>>** street addresses – distinct operations that are sometimes called "georeferencing".

=== Changes from Previous Version

There have been a few changes in terminology since the previous edition of the *_Guide_*. These include:

* *extent* in the previous version has been changed to **<<radial>>**. **<<extent,Extent>>**, where retained, is used in a more traditional way to mean the entire space within a **<<location>>**.
* "named place" has been replaced with "**<<feature>>**".
* where the **<<geographic-center>>** was recommended in the past, **<<corrected-center>>** based on the **<<geographic-radial>>** is now used. This is an important change because the **<<geographic-center>>** did not necessarily yield the smallest **<<uncertainty>>** due to the **<<extent>>** of a **<<feature>>**; the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** does.

This version of the *_Guide_* includes graphical examples of each type of location and steps for how to **<<georeference>>** them.

=== Using Darwin Core

**<<georeference,Georeferences>>** using the methods in this *_Guide_* will be of greatest value if as much information as possible is captured about and during the **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** process. The **<<Darwin-Core>>** Standard (TDWG 2018) defines all of the fields recommended for the capture of reproducible **<<georeference,georeferences>>**, as follows:

*<<Darwin-Core>>* **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** terms:

term:dwc[dwc:decimalLatitude], term:dwc[dwc:decimalLongitude], term:dwc[dwc:geodeticDatum]:: the combination of these fields provide the reference for the center of the **<<point-radius>>** representation of the **<<georeference>>**.
term:dwc[dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters]::  The horizontal distance in meters from the given term:dwc[decimalLatitude] and term:dwc[decimalLongitude] that describes the **<<smallest-enclosing-circle>>** that contains the whole of the **<<location>>**. Leave the value empty if the **<<uncertainty>>** is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no **<<coordinates>>**). Zero is not a valid value for this term. This term corresponds with the **<<geographic-radial>>** of the final **<<georeference>>**.
term:dwc[dwc:georeferencedBy], term:dwc[dwc:georeferencedDate]:: the individual(s) who last modified the **<<georeference>>** and when. These correspond to the final authority on the **<<georeference>>** in its current state, regardless of who might have worked on previous versions of the **<<georeference>>**.
term:dwc[dwc:georeferenceProtocol]::  A description or reference to the methods used to determine the **<<shape>>** using the **<<shape>>** **<<georeferencing-method>>**, or the **<<coordinates>>** and **<<uncertainty>>** using the **<<point-radius>>** **<<georeferencing-method,method>>**. If the protocol in this *_Guide_* is used unaltered, then the term:dwc[georeferenceProtocol] should be the citation for this document.
term:dwc[dwc:georeferenceSources]::  A list (concatenated and separated) of maps, **<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>**, or other resources used to **<<georeference>>** the **<<location>>**, described specifically enough to allow anyone in the future to use the same resources.

=== Georeferencing Concepts

One of the goals of **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** following best practices is to be sure that enough information is provided in the output so that the **<<georeference>>** is repeatable (see {gbp}#principles-of-best-practice[Principles of Best Practice] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). To that end, this document provides a set of recipes for **<<georeference,georeferencing>>** various **<<locality-type,locality-types>>** using the *_Georeferencing Calculator_*. The *_Calculator_* allows you to make distinct kinds of calculations based on the **<<locality-type>>** (<<Locality Type>>). When the **<<locality-type>>** is chosen from the predefined list, the *_Calculator_* presents input boxes for all of the parameters needed for that type of calculation. Note that the **<<locality-type>>** is for the most specific **<<locality-clause,clause>>** in the **<<locality>>** description (see {gbp}#parsing-the-locality-description[Parsing the Locality Description] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*), but there may be information for other **<<locality-clause,clauses>>** or other parts of the **<<location>>** record that help to constrain the **<<location>>** and come into play when a **<<feature>>** **<<boundary>>** is determined. Many *_Calculator_* parameters are used for more than one **<<locality-type>>**. Rather than repeat the explanation for each **<<locality-type>>**, they are collected here for common reference. Some **<<locality-type,locality-types>>** require specific parameters, for which the corresponding explanations are included in each subsection of <<Georeferencing Methods for Locality Type>>. Refer to the {gcm}[*_Georeferencing Calculator Manual_*] (Bloom _et al._ 2020) for details about the *_Calculator_* not answered in this document.

[#s-locality-type]
==== Locality Type

The **<<locality-type>>** refers to the pattern of the most specific part of a **<<locality>>** description to be **<<georeference,georeferenced>>** – the one that determines which calculation method to use. The *_Calculator_* has options to compute **<<georeference,georeferences>>** for six basic **<<locality-type,locality-types>>**:

* **<<coordinates,Coordinates>>** only.
* Geographic **<<feature>>** only.
* Distance only.
* Distance along a path.
* Distance along orthogonal **<<direction,directions>>**.
* Distance at a **<<heading>>**.

Selecting a **<<locality-type,Locality-Type>>** will configure the *_Calculator_* to show all of the parameters that need to be set to perform the **<<georeference>>** calculation. This *_Guide_* gives specific instructions for how to set the parameters for many different examples of each of the **<<locality-type,Locality-Types>>**.

[#s-corrected-center]
==== Corrected Center

The **<<corrected-center>>** is the point within a **<<location>>**, or on its  **<<boundary>>**, that minimizes the **<<geographic-radial>>** (see <<Radial of Feature>>). This point is obtained by finding the **<<smallest-enclosing-circle>>** that contains the entire **<<feature>>**, and then taking the center of that circle (xref:img-corrected-center[xrefstyle="short"]A). If that center does not fall on or inside the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of the **<<feature>>**, find the **<<smallest-enclosing-circle>>** that contains the entire **<<feature>>**, *but* has its center on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** (xref:img-corrected-center[xrefstyle="short"]B). Note that in the corrected case, the new circle, and hence the **<<radial>>**, will always be larger than the uncorrected one. In the *_Calculator_*, the **<<coordinates>>** corresponding to the **<<corrected-center>>** are labelled as _Input Latitude_ and _Input Longitude_.


[#img-corrected-center]
.*A*: The *center* ⓐ of the **<<smallest-enclosing-circle>>** of a **<<feature>>** (polygon highlighted in light grey). Note that the center does not fall within the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**. **B**: The **<<corrected-center>>** ⓑ, which is on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**, and the corresponding **<<geographic-radial>>** ⓒ.
image::img/web/corrected-center.png[width=597,align="center"]

==== Radial of Feature

A **<<feature>>** is a place in the **<<locality>>** description that has an **<<extent>>** and can be delimited by a  **<<boundary>>**. The **<<geographic-radial>>** of the **<<feature>>** (shown as _Radial of Feature_ in the *_Calculator_*) is the distance from the **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<feature>>** to the furthest point on the **<<geographic-boundary>>** of that **<<feature>>** (see xref:img-corrected-center[xrefstyle="short"] and {gbp}#extent-of-a-location[Extent of a Location] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). Note that the radial was called "*extent*" in early versions of the *_Calculator_*.

NOTE: The final <<georeference>> will have a <<geographic-radial>> distinct from the <<geographic-radial>> of any of the <<feature,features>> in the <<locality>> description (because it will also encompass all sources of <<uncertainty>>), and this will be captured in the output from the Calculator in the *Uncertainty* field.

[#s-latitude]
==== Latitude

Labelled as _Input Latitude_ in the *_Calculator_*. The **<<geographic-coordinates,geographic-coordinate>>** north or south of the equator (where **<<latitude>>** is 0) that represents the starting point for a **<<georeference>>** calculation and depends on the **<<locality-type>>**.

**<<latitude,Latitudes>>** in **<<decimal-degrees>>** north of the equator are positive by convention, while **<<latitude,latitudes>>** to the south are negative. The *_Calculator_* supports three degree-based **<<geographic-coordinates,geographic-coordinate>>** formats for **<<latitude>>** and **<<longitude>>**: **<<decimal-degrees>>** (_e.g._, −41.0570673), degrees decimal minutes (_e.g._, 41° 3.424"), and **<<DMS,degrees-minutes-seconds>>** (_e.g._, 41° 3' 25.44" S).

[#s-longitude]
==== Longitude

Labelled as _Input Longitude_ in the *_Calculator_*. The **<<geographic-coordinates,geographic-coordinate>>** east or west of the **<<prime-meridian>>** (an arc between the north and south poles where **<<longitude>>** is 0) that represents the starting point for a **<<georeference>>** calculation and depends on the **<<locality-type>>**.

**<<longitude,Longitudes>>** in **<<decimal-degrees>>** east of the **<<prime-meridian>>** are positive by convention, while **<<longitude,longitudes>>** to the west are negative. The *_Calculator_* supports three degree-based **<<geographic-coordinates,geographic-coordinate>>** formats for **<<latitude>>** and **<<longitude>>**: **<<decimal-degrees>>** (−71.5246934), degrees decimal minutes (71° 31.482"), and **<<DMS,degrees-minutes-seconds>>** (71° 31' 28.90" W).

==== Coordinate Source

The _Coordinate Source_ is the type of resource (map type, **<<GPS>>**, **<<gazetteer>>**, **<<locality>>** description) from which the starting _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_ were derived.

// TODO That > sign after Maps?
NOTE: More often than not, the original **<<coordinates>>** are used to find the general vicinity of the **<<location>>** on a map, after which the process of determining the **<<corrected-center>>** provides the new **<<coordinates>>**. The **Coordinate Source** to use in the **Calculator** in this case is the map from which the **<<corrected-center>>** was determined, not the original source used to determine the general vicinity on the map. For example, suppose the original **<<coordinates>>** came from a **<<gazetteer>>**, but the **<<boundary>>** and **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<feature>>** were determined from Google Maps™, the **Coordinate Source** would be "**Google Earth/Maps >2008**", not "**gazetteer**".

This term is related to, but *NOT* the same as, the **<<Darwin-Core>>** term term:dwc[georeferenceSources], which requires the specific resources used rather than their type. Note that the **<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>** from the two sources _gazetteer_ and _locality description_ can not be anticipated universally, and therefore do not contribute to the global **<<uncertainty>>** in the calculations. If the **<<error>>** characteristics of these sources are known, they can be added in the _Measurement Error_ field before calculating. If the source _GPS_ is selected, the label for _Measurement Error_ will change to _GPS Accuracy_, which is where the **<<accuracy>>** of the **<<GPS>>** (see {gbp}#using-a-gps[Using a GPS] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*) at the time the **<<coordinates>>** were taken should be entered.

[#s-coordinate-format]
==== Coordinate Format

The _Coordinate Format_ in the *_Calculator_* defines the representation of the original **<<geographic-coordinates>>** (**<<decimal-degrees>>**, **<<DMS,degrees-minutes-seconds>>** degrees decimal minutes) of the **<<coordinates,coordinate>>** source.

NOTE: More often than not, the original **<<coordinates>>** are used to find the general vicinity of the **<<location>>** on a map, after which the process of determining the **<<corrected-center>>** provides the new **<<coordinates>>**. The **Coordinate Format** to use in the **Calculator** in this case is the **<<coordinate-format>>** on the map from which the **<<corrected-center>>** was determined, not the <<coordinate-format>> of the original source used to determine the general vicinity on the map. For example, suppose the original **<<coordinates>>** came from a **<<gazetteer>>** in <<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>>, but the **<<boundary>>** and **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<feature>>** were determined from Google Maps™, the **Coordinate Format** would be **decimal degrees**, not **degrees minutes seconds**.

This term is equivalent to the **<<Darwin-Core>>** term term:dwc[verbatimCoordinateSystem]. Selecting the original **<<coordinate-format>>** allows the **<<coordinates>>** to be entered in their native format and forces the *_Calculator_* to present appropriate options for **<<coordinate-precision>>**. Changing the **<<coordinate-format>>** will automatically reset the **<<coordinate-precision>>** value to _nearest degree_. Be sure to correct this for the actual **<<coordinate-precision>>**. The *_Calculator_* stores **<<coordinates>>** in **<<decimal-degrees>>** to seven decimal places. This is to preserve the correct **<<coordinates>>** in all formats regardless of how many **<<coordinates,coordinate>>** transformations are done.

[#s-coordinate-precision]
==== Coordinate Precision

Labeled in the *_Calculator_* as _Precision_ in the first column of input parameters, this drop-down list is populated with levels of **<<precision>>** in keeping with the **<<coordinate-format>>** chosen. For example, with a _Coordinate Format_ of _degrees minutes seconds_, an _Input Latitude_ of 35° 22' 24" N and an _Input Longitude_ of 105° 22' 28" W, the _Coordinate Precision_ would be _nearest second_. A value of _exact_ is any level of **<<precision>>** higher than the otherwise highest **<<precision>>** given on a list. Sources of **<<coordinate-precision>>** may include paper or digital maps, digital imagery, **<<GPS>>**, **<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>**, or **<<locality>>** descriptions.

NOTE: The **Coordinate Precision** to use in the **Calculator** is the **<<coordinate-precision>>** of the map from which the **<<corrected-center>>** was determined, not the **<<coordinate-precision>>** of the original source used to determine the general vicinity on the map. For example, suppose the original **<<coordinates>>** came from a **<<gazetteer>>**, but the **<<boundary>>** and **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<feature>>** were determined from *_Google Maps_*, the **Coordinate Precision** would be determined by the number of digits of **<<decimal-degrees>>** you captured from the **<<corrected-center>>** on Google Maps™, not the **Coordinate Precision** of the **<<coordinates>>** from the original **<<gazetteer>>** entry. If you use all of the digits provided on Google Maps™, the **Coordinate Precision** would be **exact**.

NOTE: This term is similar to, but **NOT** the same as, the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[coordinatePrecision], which applies to the output **<<coordinates>>**.

[#s-datum]
==== Datum

Defines the position of the origin and orientation of an **<<ellipsoid>>** upon which the **<<coordinates>>** are based for the given _Input Latitude_ and __Longitude__ (see {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*).

NOTE: The **Datum** to use in the **Calculator** is the **<<datum>>** (or **<<ellipsoid>>**) of the map from which the **<<corrected-center>>** was determined. For example, suppose the original **<<coordinates>>** came from a **<<gazetteer>>** with an unknown <<datum>>, but the **<<boundary>>** and **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<feature>>** were determined from Google Maps™, the **Datum** would be **WGS84**, not **datum not recorded**.

The term _Datum_ in the *_Calculator_* is equivalent to the **<<Darwin-Core>>** term term:dwc[geodeticDatum]. The *_Calculator_* includes **<<ellipsoid,ellipsoids>>** on the __Datum __drop-down list, as sometimes that is all that **<<coordinates,coordinate>>** source shows. The choice of **<<datum>>** in the *_Calculator_* has two important effects. The first is the contribution to **<<uncertainty>>** if the **<<datum>>** of the input **<<coordinates>>** is not known. If the **<<datum>>** and **<<ellipsoid>>** are not known, _datum not recorded_ must be selected. **<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>** due to an unknown **<<datum>>** can be severe and varies geographically in a complex way with a worst-case contribution of 5359 m (see {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). The second important effect of the **<<datum>>** selection is to provide the characteristics of the **<<ellipsoid>>** model of the earth, on which the distance calculations depend.

[#s-direction]
==== Direction

The _Direction_ in the *_Calculator_* is the **<<heading>>** given in the **<<locality>>** description, either as a standard compass point (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass[_Boxing the compass_]) or as a number of degrees in the clockwise direction from north. True North is not the same as Magnetic North (see {gbp}#headings[Headings] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). If a **<<heading>>** is known to be a magnetic **<<heading>>**, it will have to be converted into a true **<<heading>>** (see NOAA's https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml[_Magnetic Field Calculator_]) before it can be used in the *_Georeferencing Calculator_*. If _degrees from N_ is selected, a text box will appear to the right of the selection, into which the degree **<<heading>>** should be entered.

NOTE: Some marine **<<locality>>** descriptions reference a direction (azimuth) toward a landmark rather than a **<<heading>>** from the current **<<location>>** (e.g., "327° to Nubble Lighthouse"). To make a **Distance** at a **<<heading>>** calculation for such a **<<locality>>** description, use the compass point 180 degrees from the one given in the **<<locality>>** description (147° in the example above) as the **Direction**.

==== Offset Distance

The _Offset Distance_ in the *_Calculator_* is the linear surface distance from a point of origin. **<<offset,Offsets>>** are used for the _Locality Types_ _Distance at a heading_ and _Distance only_. If the _Locality Type_ _Distance along orthogonal directions_ is selected, there are two distinct **<<offset,offsets>>**:

North or South Offset Distance:: The distance to the north or south (set with the selection box to the right of the distance text box) of the _Input Latitude_.

East or West Offset Distance:: The distance to the east or west (set with the selection box to the right of the distance text box) of the _Input Longitude_.

==== Distance Units

The _Distance Units_ selection denotes the real world units used in the **<<locality>>** description. It is important to select the original units as given in the description. This is needed to incorporate the **<<uncertainty>>** from **<<Distance Precision>>** properly. If the **<<locality>>** description does not include distance units, use the distance units of the map from which measurements are derived.

.{blank}
====
* select _mi_ for "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield"
* select _km_ for "3.2 km SE of Lisbon"
* select _km_ for measurements in Google Maps™ where the distance units are set to _km_.
====

==== Distance Precision

The _Distance Precision_, labeled in the *_Calculator_* as _Precision_ in the second column of input parameters, refers to the **<<precision>>** with which a distance was described in a **<<locality>>** (see {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). This drop-down list is populated based on the _Distance Units_ chosen and contains powers of ten and simple fractions to indicate the **<<precision>>** demonstrated in the verbatim original **<<offset>>**.

.{blank}
====
* select _1 mi_ for "6 mi NE of Davis"
* select _¼ km_ for "3.75 km W of Hamilton"
====

==== Measurement Error

The _Measurement Error_ accounts for **<<error>>** associated with the ability to distinguish one point from another using any measuring tool, such as rulers on paper maps or the measuring tools on Google Maps™ or Google Earth™. The units of measurement must be the same as those in the **<<locality>>** description as captured in _Distance Units_ (see <<Distance Units>>). The _Distance Converter_ at the bottom of the *_Calculator_* is provided to aid in changing a measurement to the **<<locality>>** description units. For example, a measurement error of 1 mm on a map of 1:24,000 scale would be 24 m.

==== GPS Accuracy

// TODO Enter a value... bad grammar.
When _GPS_ is selected from the _Coordinate Source_ drop-down list, the label for the _Measurement Error_ text box changes to _GPS Accuracy_. Enter a value that we recommend is at least twice the value given by the **<<GPS>>** at the time the **<<coordinates>>** were captured (see {gbp}#uncertainty-due-to-gps[Uncertainty due to GPS] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). If _GPS Accuracy_ is not known, enter 100 m for standard hand-held **<<GPS>>** **<<coordinates>>** taken before 1 May 2000 when Selective Availability was discontinued. After that, use 30 m as a conservative default value.

[#s-uncertainty]
==== Uncertainty

The _Uncertainty_ in the *_Calculator_* is the calculated result of the combination of all sources of **<<uncertainty>>** (**<<coordinate-precision>>**, unknown **<<datum>>**, data source, **<<GPS>>** **<<accuracy>>**, measurement **<<error>>**, **<<feature>> <<extent>>**, distance **<<precision>>**, and **<<heading>>** **<<precision>>**) expressed as a linear distance – the **<<geographic-radial>>** of the **<<georeference>>** and the **<<radial,radius>>** in the **<<point-radius>>** **<<georeferencing-method,method>>** (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004). Along with the _Output Latitude_, _Output Longitude_, and _Datum_, the **<<radial,radius>>** defines a circle containing all of the possible places a **<<locality>>** description could mean. In the *_Calculator_* the _Uncertainty_ is given in meters.
