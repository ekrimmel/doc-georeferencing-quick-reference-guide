=== Offsets

.**Definition**
[NOTE]
====
An *offset* is a displacement from a reference location. An offset is usually used in conjunction with heading to give a distance and direction from a feature (see {gbp}#offsets[Offsets^] and {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]. There are a variety of ways in which offsets with features and headings in locality descriptions, each with its own methods of spatial interpretation.
====

In all cases, both for the <<shape>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> and for the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> using the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator], the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the reference <<feature,feature(s)>> are needed. Thus, this section on Offsets will repeatedly refer to features as determined by the methods presented in the various sections of <<Geographic Feature only>>.

The <<locality-type,locality-types>>** that involve offsets, in addition to the tricky one we have already seen above (<<Feature – near a Feature>>), are:

* distance only (e.g. "5 mi from Bakersfield")
* <<heading>> only (e.g. "North of Bakersfield")
* distance along a <<path>> (e.g. "13 miles east (by road) from Bakersfield")
* distance along orthogonal <<direction,directions>> (e.g. "2 miles east and 3 miles north of Bakersfield")
* distance at a <<heading>> (e.g. "10 miles east (by air) from Bakersfield")
* distances from two distinct <<path,paths>> (e.g. "1.5 mile east of Louisiana State Highway 1026 and 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 190")

==== Offset – Distance only

<<locality,Locality>> consists of an <<offset>> from a <<feature>> without any direction specified.

*Locality Type:* _Distance only_

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries:* Determine the <<boundary>> of the feature as you would for <<Feature – near a Feature>>, except that the distance to use for the buffer is the distance given in the locality description, and there is no need to account for the proximity of other features.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the boundary has been determined, obtain the <<coordinates>> and the <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the coordinates of the <<corrected-center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the feature.

*Offset Distance*: Set to 0. The distance has already been incorporated in the determination of the boundary. Use the distance and units given in the locality description to <<georeference>> using the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^].

*Distance Precision:* Though the *_Offset Distance_* is set to zero, the _Distance Precision_ should still be set (see <<Distance Precision>>) to account for this source of <<uncertainty>>.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the Calculator:* _Coordinate source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _Measurement Error_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Heading only

The **<<locality>>** consists of a direction from a **<<feature>>** without any distance specified. Note that seldom is such information given alone; there is usually some supporting information. For example, the **<<locality>>** may have higher-level geographic information such as "East of Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico". This provides a stopping point (the county border), and should allow you to **<<georeference>>** the **<<locality>>**. Alternatively, there might be another similar **<<feature>>** in the direction of the given **<<heading>>** that can constrain the **<<offset>>**.

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* First determine the **<<boundary>>** of the given **<<feature>>** based on the **<<feature>>** type, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>. Then, to account for the **<<offset>>** at a **<<heading>>**, extend that **<<boundary>>** outward in a cone defined by the **<<heading>>** **<<uncertainty>>** (see {gbp}#offset-direction-only[Offset – Direction Only] and {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-heading[Uncertainty Related to Heading], both in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*) until reaching a constraining **<<boundary>>** imposed by other information in the **<<locality>>** record, or until reaching the proximity of another similar **<<feature>>**, whichever is nearer the original **<<feature>>** (xref:img-offset-heading[xrefstyle="short"]A). Call this the "extended **<<feature>>**". If the extension impinges on any similar extension of another similar **<<feature>>** in the cone of the specified **<<heading>>**, modify the **<<boundary>>** in the shared space to be half the distance between the nearest **<<boundary,boundaries>>** between the two **<<feature,features>>** (xref:img-offset-heading[xrefstyle="short"]B). For example, "N Palmetto" could mean "northern part of Palmetto" or "North of Palmetto". Since we have no way of knowing which was intended, we choose the latter interpretation, which is more inclusive and will entirely contain the less inclusive interpretation. Use the rules for **<<heading>>** **<<uncertainty>>** to determine the angle within which to find the nearest similar **<<feature>>**. For example, for "N Palmetto" look for a named place somewhere between NE and NW of Palmetto.

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once you have determined the **<<boundary>>** of the "extended" **<<feature>>**, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the extended **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Distance along a Path

The **<<locality>>** consists of a reference **<<feature>>** to start from and a distance to travel along a **<<path>>** from there. Most of the time there will be just one **<<path>>** that matches the description and it will not be very wide compared to the reference **<<feature>>**, for example, a highway out of a town, or a stream out of a lake. In cases such as these, the **<<georeferencing-method>>** is relatively simple (see <<Offset along a Narrow Path>>). If the **<<path>>** is wide enough that multiple possible routes could be taken along it, such as in a river, the method for dealing with it is a little more complicated (see <<Offset along a Wide Path>>). Sometimes there might be multiple distinct possible **<<path,paths>>** that match the **<<locality>>** description, such as two different roads in the same general direction out of a town and there is a third method to use to find the **<<georeference>>** (see <<Offset along Multiple Possible Paths>>). In all cases, the **<<georeference>>** will cover a segment of the **<<path>>** or possible **<<path,paths>>** that includes all the sources of **<<uncertainty>>**. Though there might be a **<<heading>>** mentioned in the **<<locality>>** description, it serves only to constrain which **<<path>>** or **<<path,paths>>** are possible, and does not contribute **<<uncertainty>>** due to **<<heading>>** **<<precision>>**.

NOTE: The more accumulated curvature there is in the <<path>>, the more important it is to measure carefully (and therefore use a map of appropriate scale or zoom), otherwise there will be an accumulated error in the position of the <<offset>>. The less detail there is in the map compared to the real <<path>>, the greater the overestimate of the actual distance from the starting point to the end point will be because the measurements will be "cutting corners" along the whole measured <<path>>.

*Locality Type:* _Distance along path_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Find the **<<boundary>>** of the intersection of the reference **<<feature>>** with the **<<path>>** as you would for <<feature-junction-intersection-crossing-confluence,Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence>> (xref:img-offset-narrow-path[xrefstyle="short"]).

*Step 2 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** has been determined, use the same method to determine the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** (xref:img-offset-narrow-path[xrefstyle="short"]B). Enter the length of the **<<geographic-radial>>** in _Radial of Feature_ in the *_Calculator_*.

*Step 3 – Enter the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_:* Enter the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<offset>>** position, which can be determined by measuring the length along the midline of the **<<path>>** from the **<<corrected-center>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** to the distance given in the **<<locality>>** description. See the notes on map scale and accumulated **<<error>>** in <<Offset – Distance along a Path>>.

*Step 4 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_, _Distance Precision_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

*Locality Type:* _Distance along path_

*Step 1 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Find the center of the intersection of the reference **<<feature>>** with the **<<path>>** as you would for <<feature-junction-intersection-crossing-confluence,Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence>> (xref:img-offset-wide-path[xrefstyle="short"]A).

*Step 2 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** has been determined, use the same method to determine the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** (xref:img-offset-wide-path[xrefstyle="short"]A).

*Step 3 – <<coordinates,Coordinates>> at the <<offset>> distance:* Determine the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<offset>>** position by measuring the length along the midline of the **<<path>>** from the **<<corrected-center>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** (from *Step 2*) to the distance given in the **<<locality>>** description. In a river, follow the talweg (deepest channel) if it is evident.

*Step 4 – Calculate preliminary <<uncertainty,uncertainties>>:* Calculate a preliminary **<<uncertainty>>** by entering the **<<geographic-radial>>** from Step 1 into the _Radial of feature_ in the *_Calculator_* and fill in the rest of the parameters for the _Distance along path_ **<<locality-type>>**.

*Additional parameters for Step 4:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_, _Distance Precision_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

*Step 5 – Final <<path>> <<boundary>>:* Measure in both directions along the midline of the **<<path>>** from the **<<coordinates>>** determined in *Step 3* to a distance equal to the **<<uncertainty>>** determined in *Step 4*. From each of these points, make a transverse segment across the **<<path>>** at that **<<elevation>>**. These segments form the two ends of the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<path>>**, and the edges of the **<<path>>** between these two segments complete the **<<boundary>>** (xref:img-offset-wide-path[xrefstyle="short"]).

*Step 6 – **<<path,Path>>** **<<boundary>>** <<corrected-center>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once you have determined the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<path>>** segment from *Step 5*, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, find the **<<corrected-center>>** and measure the distance from there to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<path>>** segment. Use the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** of the **<<path>>** segment for the resulting _Latitude_ and _Longitude_ and use the length of the **<<geographic-radial>>** of the final **<<path>>** segment as the final _Uncertainty_. No further calculation has to be made.

*Step 2 – Determine the <<boundary,boundaries>> for distinct **<<path,paths>>**:* For each of the distinct possible **<<path,paths>>**, determine the final **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of the **<<path>>** segment as <<Offset along a Narrow Path>> or <<Offset along a Wide Path>>, as appropriate (xref:img-offset-multiple-paths[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 3 – Determine the final <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>*: Treat the set of **<<boundary,boundaries>>** from Step 2 as parts of the same **<<feature>>**. Find the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** for this **<<feature>>** (xref:img-offset-multiple-paths[xrefstyle="short"]B).

==== Offset – Distance along Orthogonal Directions

**<<locality,Locality>>** consists of a linear distance in each of two orthogonal **<<direction,directions>>** from a **<<feature>>**. For more information and details see {gbp}#offset-along-orthogonal-directions[Offset along Orthogonal Directions] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*.

NOTE: Where <<locality,localities>> have two orthogonal measurements in them, it should always be assumed that the measurements are "by air" unless there is a reference that indicates otherwise.

*Locality Type:* _Distance along orthogonal directions_

*Step 1 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Determine the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** based on whatever the **<<feature>>** type is, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

*Step 2 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** has been determined, use the same method to determine the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the starting **<<feature>>** (xref:img-offset-orthogonal-direction[xrefstyle="short"]).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source,_ _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _North or South Offset Distance, East or West Offset Distance_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_, _Distance Precision_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

image::img/web/offset-orthogonal-direction.jpg[width=392,align="center"]

==== Offset – Distance at a Heading

**<<locality,Locality>>** consists of a distance in a given **<<direction>>** from a single **<<feature>>**. Such **<<locality,localities>>** sometimes contain an explicit indicator of how the distance was measured, (_e.g._, "by air", "air miles W of", "due N of", "as the crow flies", "by road", "downstream from", etc.). Without such an indicator the interpretation is a matter of judgment, which should be documented in term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks].

NOTE: Since an <<offset>> at a <<heading>> "by air" will usually encompass the alternative by a <<path>> anyway, this is the recommended <<locality-type>> to use if there is no indication to the contrary. You can increase the maximum <<uncertainty>> to encompass the other option. This recommendation applies if you don’t have a compelling reason to use <<Offset – Distance along a Path>>).

NOTE: The addition of an adverbial modifier to the distance part of a locality description (e.g., "about 25 km WNW Campinas"), while an honest observation, should not affect the determination of the **<<geographic-coordinates>>** or the overall **<<uncertainty>>**.

*Locality Type:* _Distance at a heading_

*Step 1 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Determine the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** based on whatever the **<<feature>>** type is, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

*Step 2 – Determine the starting <<feature>> <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, obtain the **<<coordinates>>** and the **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**.

*Locality Type:* _Distance along path_

Although this is not technically a distance along a **<<path>>**, the choice of this **<<locality-type>>** in the *_Calculator_* will allow all of the relevant parameters to be entered.

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Determine the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of the area matching the **<<locality>>** description by creating a copy of the **<<path,paths>>**, each **<<offset>>** by the distance and **<<direction>>** given. The overlap of these two copies defines the **<<extent>>** of the place described. Draw the **<<boundary>>** around the overlapping area.

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, obtain the **<<coordinates>>** and the **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _Radial of Feature_, _Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_, _Distance Precision_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).
