=== Offsets

.**Definition**
[NOTE]
====
An *offset* is a displacement from a reference location. An offset is usually used in conjunction with heading to give a distance and direction from a feature (see {gbp}#offsets[Offsets^] and {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]). There are a variety of ways in which offsets with features and headings in locality descriptions, each with its own methods of spatial interpretation.
====

In all cases, both for the <<shape>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> and for the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> using the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator], the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the reference <<feature,feature(s)>> are needed. Thus, this section on Offsets will repeatedly refer to features as determined by the methods presented in the various sections of <<Geographic Feature only>>.

The <<locality-type,locality-types>> that involve offsets, in addition to the tricky one we have already seen above (<<Feature – near a Feature>>), are:

* distance only (e.g. "5 mi from Bakersfield")
* <<heading>> only (e.g. "North of Bakersfield")
* distance along a <<path>> (e.g. "13 miles east (by road) from Bakersfield")
* distance along orthogonal <<direction,directions>> (e.g. "2 miles east and 3 miles north of Bakersfield")
* distance at a <<heading>> (e.g. "10 miles east (by air) from Bakersfield")
* distances from two distinct <<path,paths>> (e.g. "1.5 mile east of Louisiana State Highway 1026 and 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 190")

==== Offset – Distance only

<<locality,Locality>> consists of an <<offset>> from a <<feature>> without any direction specified.

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance only#

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries:* Determine the <<boundary>> of the feature as you would for <<Feature – near a Feature>>, except that the distance to use for the buffer is the distance given in the locality description, and there is no need to account for the proximity of other features.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the boundary has been determined, obtain the <<coordinates>> and the <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the coordinates of the <<corrected-center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the feature.

*Offset Distance*: Set to 0. The distance has already been incorporated in the determination of the boundary. Use the distance and units given in the locality description to <<georeference>> using the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^].

*Distance Precision:* Though the [ui-element]#Offset Distance# is set to zero, the [ui-element]#Distance Precision# should still be set (see <<Distance Precision>>) to account for this source of <<uncertainty>>.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the Calculator:* [ui-element]#Coordinate source#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#Measurement Error# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Heading only

The <<locality>> consists of a direction from a <<feature>> without any distance specified. Note that seldom is such information given alone; there is usually some supporting information. For example, the locality may have higher-level geographic information such as "East of Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico". This provides a stopping point (the county border), and should allow you to <<georeference>> the locality. Alternatively, there might be another similar feature in the direction of the given <<heading>> that can constrain the <<offset>>.

[caption=Examples]
====
* "N Palmetto" +
* "W of Berkeley" +
* "Saladillo E" +
* "Al N de Saladillo"
====

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Geographic feature only#

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries*: First determine the <<boundary>> of the given feature based on the feature type, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>. Then, to account for the offset at a heading, extend that boundary outward in a cone defined by the heading <<uncertainty>> (see {gbp}#offset-direction-only[Offset – Direction Only^] and {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-heading[Uncertainty Related to Heading^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]) until reaching a constraining boundary imposed by other information in the locality record, or until reaching the proximity of another similar feature, whichever is nearer the original feature (<<img-offset-heading>>A). Call this the "extended feature". If the extension impinges on any similar extension of another similar feature in the cone of the specified heading, modify the boundary in the shared space to be half the distance between the nearest boundaries between the two features (<<img-offset-heading>>B). For example, "N Palmetto" could mean "northern part of Palmetto" or "North of Palmetto". Since we have no way of knowing which was intended, we choose the latter interpretation, which is more inclusive and will entirely contain the less inclusive interpretation. Use the rules for heading uncertainty to determine the angle within which to find the nearest similar feature. For example, for "N Palmetto" look for a named place somewhere between NE and NW of Palmetto.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and geographic radial*: Once you have determined the boundary of the extended feature, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the <<coordinates>> of the <<corrected-center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the extended feature.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the [ui-element]#Calculator#*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#GPS Accuracy#/[ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Distance along a Path

The <<locality>> consists of a reference <<feature>> to start from and a distance to travel along a <<path>> from there. Most of the time there will be just one path that matches the description and it will not be very wide compared to the reference feature, for example, a highway out of a town, or a stream out of a lake. In cases such as these, the <<georeferencing-method>> is relatively simple (see <<Offset along a Narrow Path>>). If the path is wide enough that multiple possible routes could be taken along it, such as in a river, the method for dealing with it is a little more complicated (see <<Offset along a Wide Path>>). Sometimes there might be multiple distinct possible paths that match the locality description, such as two different roads in the same general direction out of a town and there is a third method to use to find the <<georeference>> (see <<Offset along Multiple Possible Paths>>). In all cases, the georeference will cover a segment of the path or possible paths that includes all the sources of <<uncertainty>>. Though there might be a <<heading>> mentioned in the locality description, it serves only to constrain which path or paths are possible, and does not contribute uncertainty due to heading <<precision>>.

NOTE: The more accumulated curvature there is in the path, the more important it is to measure carefully (and therefore use a map of appropriate scale or zoom), otherwise there will be an accumulated error in the position of the offset. The less detail there is in the map compared to the real path, the greater the overestimate of the actual distance from the starting point to the end point will be because the measurements will be "cutting corners" along the whole measured path.

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance along path#

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries*: Find the <<boundary>> of the intersection of the reference <<feature>> with the <<path>> as you would for <<feature-junction-intersection-crossing-confluence,Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence>> (<<img-offset-narrow-path>>).

*Step 2 – Determine the starting feature coordinates and  geographic radial*: Once the <<boundary>> of the starting <<feature>> has been determined, use the same method to determine the <<corrected-center>> and <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the <<coordinates>> of the corrected center to the furthest point on the boundary of the starting feature (<<img-offset-narrow-path>>B). Enter the length of the geographic radial in [ui-element]#Radial of Feature# in the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^].

*Step 3 – Enter the [ui-element]#Input Latitude# and [ui-element]#Longitude#*: Enter the coordinates of the <<offset>> position, which can be determined by measuring the length along the midline of the path from the corrected center of the starting feature to the distance given in the <<locality>> description. See the notes on map scale and accumulated <<error>> in <<Offset – Distance along a Path>>.

*Step 4 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the Calculator*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units#, [ui-element]#Distance Precision# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance along path#

*Step 1 – Determine the starting feature boundaries*: Find the center of the intersection of the reference <<feature>> with the <<path>> as you would for <<feature-junction-intersection-crossing-confluence,Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence>> (<<img-offset-wide-path>>A).

*Step 2 – Determine the starting feature coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the <<boundary>> of the starting feature has been determined, use the same method to determine the <<corrected-center>> and <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the <<coordinates>> of the corrected center to the furthest point on the boundary of the starting feature (<<img-offset-wide-path>>A).

*Step 3 – Coordinates at the offset distance*: Determine the coordinates of the <<offset>> position by measuring the length along the midline of the path from the corrected center of the starting feature (from *Step 2*) to the distance given in the <<locality>> description. In a river, follow the talweg (deepest channel) if it is evident.

*Step 4 – Calculate preliminary uncertainties*: Calculate a preliminary <<uncertainty>> by entering the geographic radial from *Step 1* into the [ui-element]#Radial of feature# in the {gcm}[Georeferencing Calculator] and fill in the rest of the parameters for the [ui-element]#Distance along path# <<locality-type>>.

*Additional parameters for Step 4*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units#, [ui-element]#Distance Precision# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

*Step 5 – Final path boundary*: Measure in both directions along the midline of the path from the coordinates determined in *Step 3* to a distance equal to the uncertainty determined in *Step 4*. From each of these points, make a transverse segment across the path at that <<elevation>>. These segments form the two ends of the boundary of the path, and the edges of the path between these two segments complete the boundary (<<img-offset-wide-path>>).

*Step 6 – Path boundary corrected center and geographic radial*: Once you have determined the boundary of the path segment from *Step 5*, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, find the corrected center and measure the distance from there to the furthest point on the boundary of the path segment. Use the coordinates of the corrected center of the path segment for the resulting [ui-element]#Latitude# and [ui-element]#Longitude# and use the length of the geographic radial of the final path segment as the final [ui-element]#Uncertainty#. No further calculation has to be made.

*Locality Type:* As the <<locality-type>> of the possible <<path,paths>>.

*Step 1 – Determine the starting feature boundaries*: Find the center of the intersection of the reference <<feature>> with each path as you would for <<feature-junction-intersection-crossing-confluence,Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence>> (<<img-offset-multiple-paths>>A).

*Step 2 – Determine the boundaries for distinct paths*: For each of the distinct possible paths, determine the final <<boundary,boundaries>> of the path segment as <<Offset along a Narrow Path>> or <<Offset along a Wide Path>>, as appropriate (<<img-offset-multiple-paths>>B).

*Step 3 – Determine the final coordinates and geographic radial*: Treat the set of boundaries from *Step 2* as parts of the same feature. Find the <<corrected-center>> and <<geographic-radial>> for this feature (<<img-offset-multiple-paths>>B). Use the <<coordinates>> of the corrected center of the path segment for the resulting [ui-element]#Input Latitude# and [ui-element]#Longitude# and use the length of the geographic radial of the final path segment as the final <<uncertainty>>. No further calculation is necessary.

==== Offset – Distance along Orthogonal Directions

<<locality,Locality>> consists of a linear distance in each of two orthogonal <<direction,directions>> from a <<feature>>. For more information and details see {gbp}#offset-along-orthogonal-directions[Offset along Orthogonal Directions^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^].

NOTE: Where localities have two orthogonal measurements in them, it should always be assumed that the measurements are "by air" unless there is a reference that indicates otherwise.

====
* "6 km N and 4 km W of Welna" +
* "2 mi E and 1.5 mi N of Kandy" +
* "2 miles north, 1 mile east of Boulder Falls, Boulder County, Colorado"
====

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance along orthogonal directions#

*Step 1 – Determine the starting feature boundaries*: Determine the <<boundary>> of the <<feature>> based on whatever the feature type is, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

*Step 2 – Determine the starting feature coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the boundary of the starting feature has been determined, use the same method to determine the <<corrected-center>> and <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the <<coordinates>> of the corrected center to the furthest point on the boundary of the starting feature (<<img-offset-orthogonal-direction>>).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^]*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source,# [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#North or South Offset Distance, East or West Offset Distance#, [ui-element]#GPS Accuracy#/[ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units#, [ui-element]#Distance Precision# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Distance at a Heading

<<locality,Locality>> consists of a distance in a given <<direction>> from a single <<feature>>. Such localities sometimes contain an explicit indicator of how the distance was measured, (e.g. "by air", "air miles W of", "due N of", "as the crow flies", "by road", "downstream from", etc.). Without such an indicator the interpretation is a matter of judgement, which should be documented in term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks].

NOTE: Since an offset at a heading "by air" will usually encompass the alternative by a path anyway, this is the recommended locality type to use if there is no indication to the contrary. You can increase the maximum uncertainty to encompass the other option. This recommendation applies if you don’t have a compelling reason to use <<Offset – Distance along a Path>>).

NOTE: The addition of an adverbial modifier to the distance part of a locality description (e.g. "about 25 km WNW Campinas"), while an honest observation, should not affect the determination of the <<geographic-coordinates>> or the overall <<uncertainty>>.

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance at a heading#

*Step 1 – Determine the starting feature boundaries*: Determine the <<boundary>> of the <<feature>> based on whatever the feature type is, either as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

*Step 2 – Determine the starting feature coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the boundary has been determined, obtain the <<coordinates>> and the <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the coordinates of the <<corrected-center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the feature.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georefencing Calculator^]*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source,# [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#Direction#, [ui-element]#Offset Distance#, [ui-element]#GPS Accuracy#/[ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units#, [ui-element]#Distance Precision# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Offset – Distances from Two Distinct Paths

<<locality,Locality>> consists of orthogonal <<offset>> distances, one from each of two distinct <<path,paths>>.

[caption=Example]
====
* "1.5 mi E LA Hwy. 1026 and 2 mi S U.S. 190"
====

*Locality Type:* [ui-element]#Distance along path#

Although this is not technically a distance along a path, the choice of this <<locality-type>> in the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferncing Calculator^] will allow all of the relevant parameters to be entered.

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries*: Determine the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the area matching the locality description by creating a copy of the paths, each offset by the distance and <<direction>> given. The overlap of these two copies defines the <<extent>> of the place described. Draw the boundary around the overlapping area.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and geographic radial*: Once the boundary has been determined, obtain the <<coordinates>> and the <<geographic-radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the coordinates of the <<corrected-center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the feature.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the Calculator*: [ui-element]#Coordinate Source#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Format#, [ui-element]#Datum#, [ui-element]#Coordinate Precision#, [ui-element]#Radial of Feature#, [ui-element]#Measurement Error#, [ui-element]#Distance Units#, [ui-element]#Distance Precision# (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).
