== Georeferencing Methods for Locality Type

=== Geographic Feature only

.Definition
[NOTE]
====
The simplest locality descriptions consist of only a named place, or more generally, a feature, which is often listed in a standard gazetteer and can probably be located on a map of the appropriate scale.
====

Despite how they might be presented in a <<gazetteer>> or on a map, <<feature,features>> are not points; they are areas that have a spatial <<extent>>. Some features can have an obvious spatial extent, while others may not. All variations of features are treated in this Guide as one or the other of these two main categories. The basic methodology is to try to determine the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the feature, its <<corrected-center,corrected center>> and a measure of how specific the feature is (defined here by the <<geographic-radial,geographic radial>>).

NOTE: Coordinates from geographic indexes such as gazetteers often use reference points that are not necessarily in the center of the feature. For example, a river may be referenced by its mouth, and a town by its main post office, courthouse, or main plaza. It is best to use a visual reference to determine boundaries, centers, and radials. For this reason, it is a good idea to use the gazetteer coordinates to find the feature on a map, and then use the map to find the boundaries, corrected center and geographic radial of the feature.

==== Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent

The <<locality>> refers to a geographic <<feature>> with discernible spatial <<extent>>, i.e. the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the feature can be determined easily (xref:img-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"]).

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries:* This step is to determine the <<shape>> that contains the <<feature>>. This is typically done by drawing a polygon around the feature (xref:img-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"]A), but some features may require more complex <<geometry,geometries>>, such as multiple polygons.

NOTE: Record the source (including date) used to determine the boundaries (see term:dwc[georeferenceSources]).

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates:* Use the <<coordinates>> of the <<corrected-center,corrected center>> of the <<feature>> ("*a*" in xref:img-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"]B) as the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_.

*Step 3 – Measure the geographic radial:* Measure the distance from the <<corrected-center,corrected center>> to the furthest point on the <<boundary>> of the <<feature>> ("*b*" in xref:img-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"]B) as the _Radial of Feature_.

*Step 4 – Calculate using the following additional parameters:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, and _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent

The <<locality>> refers to a geographic <<feature>> that does not have an easily discernible spatial <<boundary>>. Some features may have undefined boundaries (e.g. mountains, unincorporated towns, etc.). Other features may only have a label, with no apparent boundaries or size on a map because they are small or obscured on satellite imagery (e.g. spring, monument, etc.). Another possibility is a feature with only <<coordinates>> from a <<gazetteer>> and no discernible presence on a map.

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Estimate the feature boundaries:* Determine the <<boundary,boundaries>> of the <<feature>> as well as possible using visible evidence for the feature on a map. Try to get into the mind of the person who recorded the <<locality>>. Imagine yourself there. What circumstances would influence which feature was recorded and what circumstances would have encouraged them to choose a different feature?

For towns without obvious borders one can use the presence of buildings near the <<coordinates>> given for the town to decide where the town ends (xref:img-without-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"]). In some cases there might not be such indicators and these will be more subjective. For this reason it is particularly important to document the rationale for the selection of the locality with unclear boundaries.

[#img-without-obvious-spatial-extent]

image::img/web/without-obvious-spatial-extent.png[width=378,align="center"]

Where there are no indicators for the boundary, use the midpoint between the given feature and neighboring features with similar type, size, or importance to make a rough boundary. Though this boundary may not represent the actual feature very well, it will represent the uncertainty of where the locality is, and that is the major goal of the <<georeference>>.

For small features, where the only indicator on a map is a label and possibly a marker, or where there are only coordinates from a <<gazetteer>> (and no further indicators at those coordinates on a map), a good strategy would be to use a predefined default size based on the feature type (xref:img-without-obvious-spatial-extent-default-size[xrefstyle="short"], xref:table-default-geographic-radial[xrefstyle="short"]).

† <<grid,Grids>> based on <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinates>>, such as Quarter Degree Squares, are not square, nor are they constant. They vary in size and shape by <<latitude>>.

The boundaries between mountains can be determined by using the terrain (valleys, saddles, and plains) that separate one mountain from others around it (xref:img-mountain-boundaries[xrefstyle="short"]).

Always use term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks] to document the decisions made and the reasons for them as well as possible, including the neighboring features used for reference.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates:* Once the estimated boundary has been determined, use the coordinates of the corrected center (xref:img-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"], xref:img-without-obvious-spatial-extent[xrefstyle="short"], and xref:img-mountain-boundaries[xrefstyle="short"]B) as the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_.

*Step 3 – Measure the geographic radial:* Once the rough boundary and the coordinates of the corrected center have been determined, find the geographic radial as the _Radial of Feature_ by measuring the distance from the corrected center to the furthest point on the estimated boundary of the feature.

*Step 4 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

==== Feature – Special Cases

The following are special cases of <<feature,features>> that might or might not have an obvious spatial <<extent>>, depending on the completeness of the information available.

===== Feature – Street Address

The <<locality>> is a street address – usually with a number, a street name, and an administrative <<feature>> name.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
Av. Angel Gallardo 470, Buenos Aires, Argentina +
1 Orchard Lane, Berkeley, CA +
"21054 Baldersleigh Road, Guyra, NSW" (indicates that the locality is 21.054 km from the beginning of Baldersleigh Road).
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the feature boundaries:* Locate the address using a site such as Google Maps, Mapquest or OpenStreetMap.

a. Address <<boundary>> evident – if the map shows the <<extent>> of the address clearly, determine the boundary exactly as you would for a feature with an Obvious Spatial Extent (xref:img-street-address[xrefstyle="short"]A); (see <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>).

b. Address boundary not evident – if the exact address cannot be found, estimate the boundary as well as possible, such as the block that it must be on (xref:img-street-address[xrefstyle="short"]B), as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>. Many addresses reflect a <<grid>> system of labeling addresses. For instance, addresses between 12th Street and 13th Street would lie between 1200 and 1300.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and measure the geographic radial:* Once the boundary has been determined, use the same method to determine the coordinates and <<geographic-radial,geographic radial>> as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the coordinates of the <<corrected-center,corrected center>> to the furthest point on the boundary of the feature.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – Property

The **<<locality>>** is a property – a ranch, rancho, station, farm, finca, grange, granja, estância, plantation, hacienda, fazenda, manor, holding, estate, spread, acreage, orchard, steading, parcel, terreno, etc.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
"Victoria River Station" +
"Mathae Ranch" +
"Estancia 9 de Julio"
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Locate the property using whatever sources you can. You may have to resort to a cadastral map.

a. Property **<<boundary,boundaries>>** evident – if the map shows the **<<extent>>** of the property, determine the **<<boundary>>** exactly as you would for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>).

b. Property **<<boundary,boundaries>>** not evident – if the full **<<extent>>** of the property cannot be found, it should still be possible to determine some part of it confidently, and the rest with less certainty. Delimit the outer, uncertain feature **<<boundary,boundaries>>** as usual by following <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>. In addition, determine the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of the part of the property that is obvious following <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

*Step 2 – Determine the coordinates and geographic radial:*

a. Property **<<boundary,boundaries>>** evident – once the **<<boundary>> **is determined, determine the **<<coordinates>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** (xref:img-property-boundary[xrefstyle="short"]A).

b. Property **<<boundary,boundaries>>** not evident – once the outer **<<boundary,boundaries>>** are determined, use them to find **<<coordinates>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely find the center of the **<<smallest-enclosing-circle>>** containing the outer, uncertain  **<<boundary>>**. If that center falls within the inner, confident  **<<boundary>>**, use it to determine the **<<geographic-radial>>** by finding the distance from that point to the furthest point on the uncertain **<<boundary>>** (xref:img-property-boundary[xrefstyle="short"]B). If the center does not fall in or on the confident inner  **<<boundary>>**, let the **<<corrected-center>>** be a point on the inner confident **<<boundary>>** that minimizes the **<<geographic-radial>>** to the outer uncertain **<<boundary>>** (xref:img-property-boundary[xrefstyle="short"]C).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

[#img-property-boundary]

===== Feature – Path

A **<<path>>** is a linear **<<feature,features>>** such as a road, trail, river, stream, contour line,  **<<boundary>>**, **<<transect>>**, track of an animal’s movements, tow, trawl, etc. The **<<locality>>** may also refer to part (or subdivision) of a bigger **<<path>>**.

NOTE: a path may cross over itself, such as the track of an animal’s movements.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
"Sacramento River" +
"Arroyo Urugua-í" +
"Hwy 1" +
"along 100 m contour line"
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* As a linear **<<feature>>**, a **<<path>>** is often represented as a series of line segments (_i.e._, a polyline), with or without a buffer. When viewed on satellite imagery these **<<feature,features>>** (especially rivers) can be quite complex, so a constant buffer around the midline is not a good representation in these cases. When possible, determine the **<<boundary>>** as for any other **<<shape>>** using <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>) (xref:img-paths[xrefstyle="short"]A). Otherwise, treat the **<<boundary>>** as a polyline (xref:img-paths[xrefstyle="short"]B) and determine the **<<corrected-center>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as explained below.

NOTE: <<path,Paths>> are susceptible to change over time, so it may be best to find a map source from the period during which the event occurred. The scale is important when looking at a path on a map, as smaller scale maps reduce the complexity shown, with corners cut off, and with loops (oxbows, billabongs), etc. often not shown.

*Contour Lines* — these are linear **<<feature,features>>** defined by **<<elevation>>** or **<<depth>>**. The horizontal width of the buffer around the contour line depends on the **<<uncertainty>>** in **<<elevation>>** due either to an elevational range, or due to the imprecision in the **<<elevation>>** recorded. For example, if the **<<elevation,elevational>>** range is given as 100-200 m, then the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** defined by the contours would contain the horizontal area between the contours at 100 m and 200 m.

The determination of the **<<boundary>>** would be similar for an **<<elevation,elevational>>** buffer defined by the **<<uncertainty>>** in **<<elevation>>**. For example, if the **<<elevation>>** is given as 220 m, the elevational precision would be to the nearest 10 m and the **<<boundary>>** would be defined by the contours 210 m and 230 m.

NOTE: Buffers might require interpolation on a topographic map if they do not correspond with the printed contour lines (xref:img-paths[xrefstyle="short"]C).

These considerations apply equally to **<<depth>>** and **<<bathymetry>>** where contours are available, bearing in mind that some **<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>** contours are quite coarse.

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* If the **<<boundary>>** can be determined, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** (xref:img-paths[xrefstyle="short"]A).

If the **<<feature>>** must be treated as a polyline, draw a straight line connecting the ends of the polyline and determine its midpoint. If the midpoint falls on the polyline, that will be the center (no need for correction), and the **<<geographic-radial>>** will be the distance from that point to either of the endpoints of the polyline. If the midpoint does not fall on the polyline, move it to the point on the polyline that minimizes the distance to both endpoints. This is the **<<corrected-center>>** and the distance to the endpoints is the **<<geographic-radial>>** (xref:img-paths[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

[#img-paths]
.**<<corrected-center,Corrected-center>>** ⓐ and **<<geographic-radial>>** ⓑ for a **<<path>>**: *A* With **<<boundary>>** of the **<<path>>** as a **<<shape>>**; *B* With **<<path>>** as a polyline, showing the midpoint ⓒ between the ends of the **<<path>>**. *C* **<<boundary,Boundary>>**, center ⓒ, **<<corrected-center>>** ⓐ and **<<geographic-radial>>** ⓑ of bounded section of a contour line, in this case an isohypse of 220 m with an **<<elevation,elevational>>** **<<uncertainty>>** of 10 m.

===== Feature – Junction, Intersection, Crossing, Confluence

The **<<locality>>** is the junction of two or more **<<path,paths>>** – roads, a road and a river, the mouth of a river (__i.e., __where it meets a larger water body), a road or river and an administrative **<<boundary>>** (_e.g_., of a park), a road and a contour line, etc.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
"junction of Coora Rd. and E Siparia Rd" +
"Where Dalby Road crosses Bunya Mountains National Park Boundary" +
"confluence of Rio Claro and Rio La Hondura"
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Determine the **<<boundary>>** of the junction using routes of highways, roads, and rivers from resources such as Google Maps™, Mapquest® or OpenStreetMap, road atlases, **<<GPS>>** navigators, and satellite or aerial images (xref:img-junction[xrefstyle="short"]A). Most modern spatial data can be used to determine the actual **<<boundary,boundaries>>**. If the only available representation of the junction shows the adjoining **<<path,paths>>** as lines, then the **<<boundary>>** must be determined as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>.

For a confluence of two waterways, the **<<boundary>>** is a triangle that consists of the two segments at the same **<<elevation>>** reaching from where the waterways join to the opposite shores at the same **<<elevation>>**, plus the segment that joins those two points on the opposite shores (xref:img-junction[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, use the same method to determine the **<<coordinates>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** (xref:img-junction[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

[#img-junction]

===== Feature – Cave

The **<<locality>>** is a cave, an underground mine, etc. For details of how to record a **<<locality>>** within a cave, see {gbp}#caves[Caves] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
"Giant Dome, Hall of Giants, Carlsbad Caverns" +
"Cueva de Las Brujas"
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> **<<boundary,boundaries>>**:* Locate the cave and/or its main entrance.

a. Cave **<<extent>>** evident – if a map of all the interior of the cave with measurements and orientation to the surface is available, or if a position can be determined directly above the **<<location>>** inside the cave using the **<<ground-zero>>** concept (see {gbp}#determining-location[Determining Location] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*), determine the **<<boundary>>** as if it is a <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>> (xref:img-caves[xrefstyle="short"]A).

b. Cave **<<extent>>** not evident – if the limits of the cave are not evident: a) use the nearest identifiable **<<feature>>** to determine the **<<extent>>** and **<<boundary>>** of the cave, as for <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>> (xref:img-caves[xrefstyle="short"]B); or b) determine the **<<coordinates>>** of the cave entrance and use any evidence of the size of the cave to circumscribe the **<<boundary>>** as a circle around the entrance with a **<<radial,radius>>** commensurate with its size (xref:img-caves[xrefstyle="short"]C). Document accordingly in term:dwc[georeferenceRemarks].

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, use the same method to determine the **<<coordinates>>** and **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – Dive Location

The **<<locality>>** is a diving site (marine or freshwater). Commonly recorded using the **<<geographic-coordinates>>** of the point on the surface where the diver entered the water (_i.e_., the **<<entry-point>>**).

.{blank}
[caption=Example]
====
"Exploratory dive extending in a rough circle of 20 meters diameter between depths of 75 and 100 meters, beginning 100 meters south east of the entry point at a depth of 85 meters."
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Locate the **<<extent>>** of the dive as a 3D-shape, which should be projected perpendicularly onto the water surface. Determine the **<<boundary>>** of that projection in the horizontal plane (_i.e._, the **<<geographic-boundary>>**) (xref:img-dive-location[xrefstyle="short"]).

a. Dive **<<extent>>** evident – underwater **<<location,locations>>** are often recorded as a distance, **<<direction>>** and water **<<depth>>** from the *<<entry-point>>*. Below the surface there may be a "trajectory" with a three dimensional aspect that includes a horizontal component and a minimum and maximum water **<<depth>>**. Use these to circumscribe the **<<boundary>>** on the surface (see xref:img-dive-location[xrefstyle="short"]A and {gbp}#three-dimensional-shapes[Three Dimensional Shapes] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*).

b. Dive **<<extent>>** not evident – if the limits of the dive are not evident, there is no trajectory, and no distance or direction from the **<<entry-point>>**, use a reasonable upper limit for the distance the diver might have been able to cover in a straight line from and back to the **<<entry-point>>**. This could vary greatly depending on the diver, the depth reached, equipment used, etc. Use any evidence of the length of the dive to circumscribe the **<<boundary>>** as a circle around the **<<entry-point>>** with a **<<radial,radius>>** commensurate with that length (xref:img-dive-location[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – Headwaters of a Waterway

The headwater of a waterway may or may not be well defined. For most sizable rivers a headwater is designated. If not, there is no universally agreed upon definition for a headwater. A reasonable interpretation might be the beginning of the most upstream first order stream that is a tributary of the named waterway. However, there is no guarantee that the author of the **<<locality>>** description used that definition. Therefore, we recommend the conservative solution that includes the watershed of all of the streams of lower order than the waterway mentioned.

.{blank}
[caption=Examples]
====
"headwaters of the Missouri River" +
"Cabecera Río Manso"
====

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* When the position of a headwater is well known, the feature is just the spring, lake, marsh, or beginning of the stream as generally accepted and treat as <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>. If the headwater issues from a stationary waterbody such as a spring or lake, the feature is a line segment or polyline across the area where the water flows out of the stationary waterbody. In the latter case, treat the **<<boundary>>** as for a **<<path>>** (see <<Feature – Path>>), albeit a short one, as it is transverse to the flow of the waterway (xref:img-headwater[xrefstyle="short"]).

If the headwater is not designated, use the set of all of the streams upstream of the waterway mentioned. Draw the least convex polygon containing the entire set of streams as the *boundary* (xref:img-watershed[xrefstyle="short"]).

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the  **<<boundary>>**. The **<<corrected-center>>** should be on a waterbody within the **<<boundary,boundaries>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – near a Feature

The **<<locality>>** is given with a proximity to a **<<feature>>**, usually written as "near", "in the vicinity of", or "adjacent to", without any particular **<<heading>>** or distance. "Off" of a locality, often seen in marine locations, is included here, but in this case there is at least one constraint imposed by the shore.

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* First determine the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>** itself based on the **<<feature>>** type, either as <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, or as <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>>. Then, to account for the proximity indicator, extend that **<<boundary>>** outward for a fixed distance in all directions (xref:img-near-a-feature[xrefstyle="short"]A). Call this the "extended **<<feature>>**". If the extension overlaps the extension of any other similar **<<feature>>**, modify the **<<boundary>>** in the shared space to be half the distance between the nearest **<<boundary,boundaries>>** between the two **<<feature,features>>** (xref:img-near-a-feature[xrefstyle="short"]B).

NOTE: Neighboring <<feature,features>> were not necessarily there at the time the <<locality>> was recorded, nor were they necessarily the same size. The <<feature>> of interest may have changed size in the time between the recording of the <<locality>> and the time when the map you use was made. These considerations add to the vagaries associated with this type of **<<locality>>** and underline the importance to never describe <<locality,localities>> in this way.

NOTE: The buffer distance for the extension is arbitrary – it is hard to defend any given value as a default. Make a judgement and imagine what the person who recorded the <<locality>> meant. Document the rationale and decisions made in georeferenceRemarks. Remember, one goal of a <<georeference>> is that it is repeatable.

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** of the "extended" **<<feature>>** has been determined, treat as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the extended **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – between Two Features

The **<<locality>>** description uses the pattern "between A and B", where A and B are two distinct **<<feature,features>>**.

"between Missoula and Florence, Montana" +
"Entre Pampa Blanca y Pampa Vieja, Jujuy" +

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Determine the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of each **<<feature>>** as <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>> or <<Feature – without Obvious Spatial Extent>> (xref:img-between-two-features[xrefstyle="short"]A).

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once you have determined the **<<boundary,boundaries>>** of the two **<<feature,feature>>**, find their **<<corrected-center,corrected-centers>>**, as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>. Use the midpoint between the **<<corrected-center,corrected-centers>>** of the two **<<feature,features>>** (xref:img-between-two-features[xrefstyle="short"]B) to determine the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<location>>** between the **<<feature,features>>**. The **<<geographic-radial>>** of the **<<location>>** between the two **<<feature,features>>** is half the distance between the **<<corrected-center,corrected-centers>>** of the **<<feature,features>>** (xref:img-between-two-features[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _Radial of Feature_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).

===== Feature – between Two Paths

The **<<locality>>** describes a **<<location>>** between two **<<path,paths>>** (two roads, two rivers, a road and a river, etc.).

[caption=Examples]
====
"between the Great Western Hwy and the railway line" +
"between Tanama R. and Clearwater Ck." +
"entre Av. Corrientes y Av. Córdoba" (_i.e._, two streets that don’t intersect).

*Locality Type:* _Geographic feature only_

*Step 1 – Determine the <<feature>> <<boundary,boundaries>>:* Create a **<<boundary>>** that includes the two **<<path,paths>>** and any other **<<boundary,boundaries>>** that terminate those **<<path,paths>>** (_e.g._, the border of a given administrative division) (xref:img-between-two-paths[xrefstyle="short"]A).

NOTE: <<path,Paths>> may cross each other one or more times, with the area between switching from one side of each **<<path>>** to the other, resulting in a **boundary** consisting of multiple polygons (xref:img-between-two-paths[xrefstyle="short"]B).

*Step 2 – Determine the <<coordinates>> and <<geographic-radial>>:* Once the **<<boundary>>** has been determined, obtain the **<<coordinates>>** and the **<<geographic-radial>>** as for <<Feature – with Obvious Spatial Extent>>, namely, measure the distance from the **<<coordinates>>** of the **<<corrected-center>>** to the furthest point on the **<<boundary>>** of the **<<feature>>**.

*Step 3 – Calculate using the following additional parameters in the _Calculator_:* _Coordinate Source_, _Coordinate Format_, _Datum_, _Coordinate Precision_, _GPS Accuracy_/_Measurement Error_, _Distance Units_ (see <<Georeferencing Concepts>>).
