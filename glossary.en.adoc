== Glossary

The purpose of this glossary is to describe important concepts in accordance with the intended meaning in this document, the associated {gbp}[*_Georeferencing Best Practices_*] (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020) and the {gcm}[*_Georeferencing Calculator_*] (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020). These concepts are treated in broader contexts in many other sources. We have adapted the terms presented here from many sources including Wikipedia (as of November, 2019), the ESRI Dictionary (as of November, 2019) (ESRI _n.dat._), and various articles within Kemp (2008).

[glossary]
[[accuracy]]accuracy:: the closeness of an estimated value (for example, measured or computed) to a standard or accepted ("true") value. Antonym: inaccuracy Compare <<error>>, <<bias>>, <<precision>>, {gbp}#false-precision[false precision] and <<uncertainty>>.
+
NOTE: "the true value is not known, but only estimated, the accuracy of the measured quantity is also unknown. Therefore, accuracy of coordinate information can only be estimated." (Geodetic Survey Division 1996, FGDC 1998).

[[antimeridian]]antimeridian:: is the <<meridian>> of <<longitude>> opposite a given meridian. A meridian and its *antimeridian* form a continuous ring around the Earth. The "Antimeridian" is the specific meridian of longitude opposite the <<prime-meridian>> and is used as the rough basis of the International Date Line.

[[bathymetry]]bathymetry::
1. the measure of <<depth>> of water in oceans, seas and lakes.
2. the shapes of underwater terrains, including underwater topography and sea floor mapping.

[[bias]]bias:: the difference between the average value of a set of measurements and the accepted true value. Bias is equivalent to the average systematic <<error>> in a set of measurements and a correction to negate the systematic error can be made by adjusting for the bias. Compare <<accuracy>>, error, <<precision>>, {gbp}#false-precision[false precision] and <<uncertainty>>.

[[boundary]]boundary:: the spatial divide between what is inside a <<location>> and what is outside of it.

[[bounding-box]]bounding box:: an area defined by the <<coordinates>> of two diagonally opposite corners of a polygon, where those two corners define the north-south and east-west extremes of the area contained within.

[[coordinate-format]]coordinate format:: the format in which <<coordinates>> are encoded, such as "<<decimal-degrees>>", "<<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>>", "degrees decimal minutes", or <<UTM>>.

[[coordinate-precision]]coordinate precision:: the fraction of a degree corresponding to the number of significant digits in the source <<coordinates>>. For example, if the coordinates are reported to the nearest minute, the <<precision>> is 1/3600th (0.00027778) of a degree; if a <<decimal-degrees,decimal degree>> is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree.

[[coordinate-reference-system]]coordinate reference system:: (also {gbp}#spatial-reference-system[spatial reference system]) a <<coordinate-system>> defined in relation to a standard reference or <<datum>>.

[[coordinate-system]]coordinate system:: a geometric system that defines the nature and relationship of the <<coordinates>> it uses to uniquely define positions. Examples include the {gbp}geographic-coordinate-system[geographic coordinate system] and the <<UTM>> <<coordinate-system>>.

[[coordinate-uncertainty]]coordinate uncertainty:: a measure of the minimum distance on the surface from a <<coordinates,coordinate>> within which a <<locality>> might be interpreted to be.

[[coordinates]]coordinates:: a set of values that define a position within a <<coordinate-system>>. <<coordinates,Coordinates>> are used to represent <<location,locations>> in space relative to other locations.

[[coordinateUncertaintyInMeters]]coordinateUncertaintyInMeters:: the <<Darwin-Core>> term corresponding to the {gbp}#maximum-uncertainty-distance[maximum uncertainty distance] when given in meters.

[[corrected-center]]corrected center:: the point within a <<location>>, or on its <<boundary>>, that minimizes the <<geographic-radial>> of the location. This point is obtained by making the <<smallest-enclosing-circle>> that contains the entire <<feature>>, and then taking the center of that circle. If that center does not fall inside the boundaries of the feature, make the smallest enclosing circle that has its center on the boundary of the feature. Note that in the second case, the new circle, and hence the <<radial>>, will always be larger than the uncorrected one (see {gbp}#img-polygon-center[illustration]).

[[Darwin-Core]]Darwin Core:: is a standard for exchanging information about biological diversity (see https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/[_Darwin Core_]).

[[datum]]datum:: a set of one or more parameters that serve as a reference or basis for the calculation of other parameters [ISO 19111]. A datum defines the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of the axes of a <<coordinate-system>>. For <<georeference,georeferencing>> purposes, a *datum* may be a {gbp}#geodetic-datum[geodetic datum] or a {gbp}#vertical-datum[vertical datum].

[[decimal-degrees]]decimal degrees:: degrees expressed as a single real number (_e.g._, −22.343456). Note that <<latitude,latitudes>> south of the equator are negative, as are <<longitude,longitudes>> west of the <<prime-meridian>> to −180 degrees. See also {gbp}#decimal-latitude[decimal latitude] and {gbp}#decimal-longitude[decimal longitude].

[[depth]]depth:: a measurement of the vertical distance below a {gbp}#vertical-datum[vertical datum]. In this document, we try to modify the term to signify the medium in which the measurement is made. Thus, "water depth" is the vertical distance below an air-water interface in a waterbody (ocean, lake, river, sinkhole, etc.). Compare {gbp}#distance-above-surface[distance above surface]. **Depth** is always a non-negative number.

[[direction]]direction:: _see_ <<heading>>.

[[DMS]]DMS:: degrees, minutes and seconds – one of the most common formats for expressing <<geographic-coordinates>> on maps. A degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and each minute is divided into 60 seconds of arc. Degrees, minutes and seconds are denoted by the symbols °, ′, ″. Degrees of <<latitude>> are integers between 0 and 90, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (_e.g._, N or S). Degrees of <<longitude>> are integers between 0 and 180, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (_e.g._, E or W).

[[easting]]easting:: within a <<coordinate-reference-system>> (_e.g._, as provided by a <<GPS>> or a map <<grid>> reference system), the line representing eastward distance from a reference <<meridian>> on a map.

[[elevation]]elevation:: a measurement of the vertical distance of a land or water surface above a {gbp}#vertical-datum[vertical datum]. On maps, the reference <<datum>> is generally some interpretation of {gbp}:mean-sea-level[mean sea level] or the {gbp}#geoid[geoid], while in devices using <<GPS>>/{gbp}#GNSS[GNSS], the reference datum is the <<ellipsoid>> of the {gbp}#geodetic-datum[geodetic datum] to which the GPS unit is configured, though the device may make corrections to report the elevation above mean sea level or the geoid. **Elevations** that are above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. Compare <<depth>>, {gbp}#distance-above-surface[distance-above-surface], and {gbp}#altitude[altitude].

[[ellipsoid]]ellipsoid:: a three-dimensional, closed geometric <<shape>>, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three independent axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution. When used to represent a model of the earth, the ellipsoid is an oblate ellipsoid of revolution made by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.

[[entry-point]]entry point:: the entry point on the surface of the ocean or lake where a diver enters the water and from which all activities are measured. See {gbp}#img-underwater-event[illustration].

[[error]]error:: the difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value. It encompasses both the <<precision,imprecision>> of a measurement and its inaccuracies. Error can be either random or systematic. If the <<error>> is systematic, it is called "<<bias>>". Compare <<accuracy>>, bias, precision, {gbp}#false-precision[false precision] and <<uncertainty>>.

[[extent]]extent:: the entire space within the <<boundary>> a <<location>> actually represents. The extent can be a volume, an area, or a distance.

[[feature]]feature:: an object of observation, measurement, or reference that can be represented spatially. Often categorized into "*feature types*" (_e.g._, mountain, road, populated place, etc.) and given names for specific instances (_e.g._, "Mount Everest", "Ruta 40", "Istanbul"), which are also sometimes referred to as "named places", "place names" or "toponyms".

[[gazetteer]]gazetteer:: an index of geographical <<feature,features>> and their <<location,locations>>, often with <<geographic-coordinates>>.

[[geocode]]geocode:: the process (verb) or product (noun) of determining the <<coordinates>> for a street address. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for <<georeference>>.

[[geographic-boundary]]geographic boundary:: the representation in <<geographic-coordinates>> of a vertical projection of a <<boundary>> onto a model of the surface of the earth.

[[geographic-center]]geographic center:: the midpoint of the extremes of <<latitude>> and <<longitude>> of a <<feature>>. *Geographic centers* are relatively easy to determine, but they generally do not correspond to the center obtained by a least circumscribing circle. For that reason it is not recommended to use a *geographic center* for any application in <<georeference,georeferencing>>. Compare <<corrected-center>>.

[[geographic-coordinates]]geographic coordinates:: a measurement of a <<location>> on the earth's surface expressed as <<latitude>> and <<longitude>>.

[[geographic-radial]]geographic radial:: the distance from the <<corrected-center>> of a <<location>> to the furthest point on the <<geographic-boundary>> of that location. The geographical radial is what contributes to calculations of the {gbp}#maximum-uncertainty-distance[maximum uncertainty distance] using the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method>>. The term *geographic radial,* as defined here, replaces its equivalent "extent" used in the early versions of this _Quick Reference Guide_ and related documents. // TODO chopped off the rest of this.

[[geometry]]geometry:: the measures and properties of points, lines, and surfaces. **Geometry** is used to represent the {gbp}#geographic-component[geographic component] of <<location,locations>>.

[[georeference]]georeference:: the process (verb) or product (noun) of interpreting a <<locality>> description into a spatially mappable representation using a <<georeferencing-method>>. Compare with <<geocode>>. The usage here is distinct from the concept of <<georeference,georeferencing>> satellite and other imagery (known as georectification).

[[georeferencing-method]]georeferencing method:: the type of spatial representation produced as the output of a <<georeferencing-protocol>>. In this document we discuss three particular methods of representation in detail, the <<shape>> method, the <<bounding-box>> method, and the <<point-radius>> method.

[[georeferencing-protocol]]georeferencing protocol:: the documented specific steps to apply to a <<locality>>, based on the <<locality-type>>, to produce a particular type of spatial representation.

[[GPS]]GPS:: Global Positioning System, a satellite-based system used for determining positions on or near the earth. Orbiting satellites transmit radio signals that allow a receiver to calculate its own <<location>> as <<coordinates>> and <<elevation>>, sometimes with <<accuracy>> estimates. A **GPS** or {gbp}#GNSS[GNSS] Receiver (including those in smartphones and cameras) is the instrument that receives the radio signals and translates them into <<geographic-coordinates>>. See also GNSS of which **GPS** is one example.

[[GPS-receiver]]GPS (receiver):: The colloquial term used to refer to both **GPS** and {gbp}#GNSS[GNSS] receivers. A *GPS* or GNSS receiver is an instrument which, in combination with an inbuilt or separate antenna, is able to receive and interpret signals from GNSS satellites.

[[grid]]grid:: a network or array of evenly spaced orthogonal lines used to organize space into partitions. Often these are superimposed on a map and used for reference, such as <<UTM>> grid.

[[ground-zero]]ground zero:: the <<location>> on the land surface directly above a radiolocation point in a cave where the magnetic radiation lines are vertical. See {gbp}#img-vertical-position-in-a-cave[illustration].

[[heading]]heading:: compass direction such as east or northwest, or sometimes given as degrees clockwise from north. Usually used in conjunction with <<offset>> to give a distance and direction from a <<feature>>.

[[latitude]]latitude:: the angular distance of a point north or south of the equator.

[[locality]]locality:: the verbal representation of a <<location>>, also sometimes called _**locality** description_.

[[locality-clause]]locality clause:: a part of a <<locality>> description that can be categorized into one of the <<locality-type,locality types>>, to which a specific <<georeferencing-method>> can be applied.

[[locality-type]]locality type:: a category applied to a <<locality-clause>> that determines the specific <<georeferencing-method>> that should be applied.

[[location]]location:: a physical space that can be positioned and oriented relative to a reference point, and potentially described in a natural language <<locality>> description. In <<georeference,georeferencing>>, a **location** can have distinct representations based on distinct {gbp}#rules-of-interpretation[rules of interpretation], each of which is embodied in a <<georeferencing-method>>.

[[longitude]]longitude:: the angular distance of a point east or west of a <<prime-meridian>> at a given <<latitude>>.

[[meridian]]meridian:: a line on the surface of the earth where all of the <<location,locations>> have the same <<longitude>>. Compare <<antimeridian>> and <<prime-meridian>>.

[[northing]]northing:: within a <<coordinate-reference-system>> (_e.g._, as provided by a <<GPS>> or a map <<grid>> reference system), the line representing northward distance from a reference <<latitude>>.

[[offset]]offset:: a displacement from a reference <<location>>. Usually used in conjunction with <<heading>> to give a distance and <<direction>> from a <<feature>>.

[[path]]path:: a route or track between one place and another. In some cases the path may cross itself.

[[point-radius]]point-radius:: a representation of the {gbp}#geographic-component[geographic component] of a <<location>> as a <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> and a {gbp}#maximum-uncertainty-distance[maximum uncertainty distance]. The <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method>> produces <<georeference,georeferences>> that include <<geographic-coordinates>>, a <<coordinate-reference-system>>, and a maximum uncertainty distance that encompasses all of the possible geographic coordinates where a <<locality>> might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> within a circle. The point-radius method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (<<elevation>>, <<depth>>, {gbp}#distance-above-surface[distance above surface]).

[[precision]]precision::
+
--
1. the closeness of a repeated set of observations of the same quantity to one another – a measure of control over random <<error>>.
2. with values, it describes the finest unit of measurement used to express that value (_e.g._, if a record is reported to the nearest second, the precision is 1/3600^th^ of a degree; if a <<decimal-degrees,decimal degree>> is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree).
--
+
Antonym: imprecision. Compare <<accuracy>>, <<error>>, <<bias>>, {gbp}#false-precision[false precision], and <<uncertainty>>.

[[prime-meridian]]prime meridian:: the set of <<location,locations>> with <<longitude>> designated as 0 degrees east and west, to which all other longitudes are referenced. The Greenwich <<meridian>> is internationally recognized as the <<prime-meridian>> for many popular and official purposes.

[[radial]]radial:: the distance from a center point (_e.g._, the <<corrected-center,corrected>> or <<geographic-center>>) within a <<location>> to the furthest point on the outermost <<boundary>> of that location. See also <<geographic-radial>>.

[[shape]]shape:: synonym of {gbp}#footprint[footprint]. A representation of the {gbp}#geographic-component[geographic component] of a **location** as a <<geometry>>. The result of a <<georeferencing-method,shape georeferencing method>> includes a shape as the geographic component of the <<georeference>>, which contains the set of all possible <<geographic-coordinates>> where a <<location>> might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> within the geometry given. The *shape* method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (<<elevation>>, <<depth>>, {gbp}#distance-above-surface[distance above surface]).

[[smallest-enclosing-circle]]smallest enclosing circle:: a circle with the smallest radius (<<radial>>) that contains all of a given set of points (or a given <<shape>>) on a surface (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem[_Smallest-circle problem_]). This is seldom the same as the <<geographic-center>>, nor the midpoint between two most distant <<geographic-coordinates>> of a <<location>>.

[[transect]]transect:: a <<path>> along which observations, measurements, or samples are made. Transects are often recorded as a starting <<location>> and a terminating location.

[[uncertainty]]uncertainty:: a measure of the incompleteness of one’s knowledge or information about an unknown quantity whose true value could be established if complete knowledge and a perfect measuring device were available (Cullen & Frey 1999). <<georeferencing-method,Georeferencing methods>> codify how to incorporate uncertainties from a variety of sources (including <<accuracy>> and <<precision>>) in the interpretation of a <<location>>. Compare accuracy, <<error>>, <<bias>>, precision, and {gbp}#false-precision[false precision].

[[UTM]]UTM:: Universal Transverse Mercator, a standardized <<coordinate-system>> based on a metric rectangular <<grid>> system and a division of the earth into sixty 6-degree longitudinal zones. The scope of **UTM** covers from 84° N to 80° S. (See {gbp}#universal-transverse-mercator-utm-coordinates[Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinates]).
